    "### Introduction\n",
    "This project analyzes data collected from a Minecraft research server run by a UBC Computer Science group (Frank Wood). The dataset comprises two linked tables: players.csv (one row per player with profile and demographics) and sessions.csv (one row per play session with timestamps). These logs were gathered to support real operational needs—targeting recruitment and planning server capacity."
